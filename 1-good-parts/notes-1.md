# Chapter 1- Good Parts

## Take Away:

- Good stuff
  - functions
  - dynamic object
  - expressive object litreal notion
- Bad stuff
  - program based on global variable
- JavaScript is a loosley typed language, so JavaScripts compilers are unable to detect type errors while compiling.
- JavaScripts has a **powerfull object notation** which
  inspired from **JSON**

## Clarity required:

- lamda language
- prototypal inheritence
  - object inherit from other objects?
- JavaScript depends on global variable for linkage
